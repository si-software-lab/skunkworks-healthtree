A common operating picture (COP) is a single, shared display of relevant information that provides a unified and comprehensive view of an incident or situation for all involved parties. It is used in military and emergency response to facilitate collaborative planning and improve situational awareness by consolidating data from various sources like maps, resource locations, and real-time feeds into one place. This allows commanders and responders to make faster, more informed decisions.  
Key components and features
Shared information: A COP integrates and displays data from multiple sources, such as ground reports, aerial views, GIS systems, and live video feeds. 
Unified display: It presents a single, consistent view of the operational environment to everyone involved, from high-level commanders to field personnel. 
Improved situational awareness: By creating a richer, more detailed understanding of the situation, it helps all parties maintain awareness of current status, resource availability, and potential threats. 
Enhanced decision-making: The real-time, comprehensive view allows for better planning, dynamic execution, and more effective response efforts. 
Examples in practice
Military: Modern military command and control systems use electronic COPs to track friendly and enemy forces, as well as critical infrastructure like bridges and roads. 
Emergency response: Emergency management agencies use COPs to coordinate responses to large-scale incidents, track resource locations, and provide a unified view to multiple agencies involved in the response. 
Medical response: The Medical Common Operating Picture (MedCOP) provides real-time health surveillance and medical operations visibility to help medical commanders make informed decisions.
